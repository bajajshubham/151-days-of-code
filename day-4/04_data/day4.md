- == , === diff for js objects & js primitive Data-types
- I discovered new loop variant: for ( let binding of binding ) { };
- rest parameter or ... dot operator is beautiful
- What is succinct, let me DESTRUCTURE you my bag ``` i.e. Arrays and Objects ```
- Today I get neuron link What if i could sent my entire computer memory along with the address of the values i am intrested in then how i serialize the values
