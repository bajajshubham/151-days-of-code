# FUNCTIONS

- var vs let and const (prejs-2015 and after it), mpre to binding is still binding replacing let,const over var tells more
- lexical scoping how much it is related to biniding visibility...
- I think it must go like this let vs var or const vs let and var
- How functions are conceptually moved to top of their scope and are not part of regular top-bottom flow
- How can you write a function which will accept whole list of arguments passed to it and still stays with same expression
- Hint: Console.log()
- To learn javascript, I have to flush my previous programming mental model, closures refereing local bindings how easy they have made it. I need comparison with java,c++ and c.
- ```Thinking about programs like this takes some practice. A good mental model is to think of function values as containing both the code in their body and the environment in which they are created. When called, the function body sees the environment in which it was created, not the environment in which it is called.```
- I think like i need TOC and COA books in-hand-with me while learning js or don't i am over-powering js
- I have to not to add my cleverness unless untill i am sure i need it
- I feel Bindings declared with var keyword or changed from let to var and to let again causes scope to nearest function, block or global scope
